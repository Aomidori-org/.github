Aomidori is an experimental cloud-first web-framework for large-scale applications.

Some unique challenges of large-scale applications is that many different developers and teams may be contributing
to UI components.

Aomidori allows teams to
- Bring their own technologies
- Choose their own rendering-strategires (CSR, SSR)
- Work independantly on UIs (mono-repo, polyrepo)

# Why Aomidori
Aomidori allows for teams to choose beteen micro-frontends, front-end/backend or monoliths.
